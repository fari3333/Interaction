        <h2>Entry One: Project Description</h2>
        <p>This project reimagines the American flag as a dynamic, interactive website that examines the flag’s symbolism through both artistic and political lenses. By transforming the website into the flag itself, the project invites viewers to explore the tension between patriotism and dissent in modern America.</p>
        <p>This project aims to explore and challenge the multiple interpretations that the flag embodies. Understanding the flag as a living symbol is crucial because it offers a mirror into the complex and sometimes conflicting narratives of what it means to be American.</p>
        <p>The project explores how one symbol—the American flag—can hold different meanings for different people, depending on their race, class, gender, and political beliefs. At its core, this project leverages art to interrogate the American flag's duality as a symbol of both patriotism and protest.</p>
        <p>This project aims to innovate flag representation through dynamic and interactive design elements. It seeks to provoke thought and inspire new perspectives, encouraging viewers to engage with the flag's deeper meanings through visual art.</p>
        <p>Using art to examine the American flag's dual role as a symbol of patriotism and protest, it highlights art's capacity to question power and stimulate dialogue for change.</p>

        <h2>Importance of the Project</h2>
        <p>In a polarized society, art inspires political discussions without confrontation, prompting viewers to reflect on their evolving relationship with the flag and national identity.</p>
