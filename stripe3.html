                nadeem haidary’s ‘state of the union’ takes a set of metrics and visually transforms elements on the flag to represent the country’s current state, making it a dynamic and information-driven symbol. over years or decades, citizens would be able to perceive shifts in the country as they get wealthier, healthier and live better lives — or not.
                
                 
                
                in the case of the american flag here, meaning is driven by the condition of the citizens it represents rather than abstract notions of statehood or bygone colonies. the stars represent each year of life expectancy. the blue field on which they sit stretches based on GDP per capita. the stripes are a sort of horizontal bar graph showing five different socioeconomic metrics: unemployment, divorce rate, homicide rate, school enrollment and gender salary ratios.
